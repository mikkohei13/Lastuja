# Documentation of Lastuja

Lastuja (wood shavings) is a collection of small tools & pages, built mainly for learning or trying out new things. This documentation is a test of using Bookdown-style manual building, using a repository for all the manual content.

Starting with plain Markdown instead of R Markdown, because I dont have permissions to install R IDE yet...
