# 2018-03-26 - Design and development of registration form 

[< Back to front](./)

## Happened during last sprint

The entry form now includes refined **feature observation handling**. This allows recording multiple features (measurements, bone counts, sex and age), and additional information about these features and how they were recorded (method/unit, date, person and remarks). This can be be later customized to allow more efficient handling of the most important features in a given collection.

Infrastructure work in the background continues (data model, database and testing), as well as preparing for data migration from current system to DINA by documenting the data.

We have new designs ready for:
- Physical objects
- Handling of different types of dates 
- Record events, i.e. information about when the data was previously saved and where
- Curatorial assessments, e.g. status and condition of specimens

Latest features can be viewed at https://alpha-cm.dina-web.net (username "john doe", ask password from DINA team at NRM)

The mock data version is not actively updated anymore, since the new Javascript-based stack allows us develop both back- and front-end synchronously within the main version.

## Next we are going to

- Develop new features according to the designs made, including
   - Curated locality handling: adding and editing curated localities and connecting them to specimens.
   - Several physical objects
- Design new features
   - Handling storage locations
   - Adding additional identifiers, e.g. from different data management systems
