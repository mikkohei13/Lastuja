# 2018-04-03 - New fields for registration form

## Happened during last sprint

We we mostly adding new fields and features to the specimen registration form:

Ability to add several **physical objects and curatorial assessments** about them. A curatorial assessment means information about the object’s existence and condition at a given time.

![Physical Object](https://github.com/DINA-Web/documentation/raw/master/news-assets/pysicalObject.png)

*This shows an example of a specimen consisting of a skeleton and a skin that was previously missing.*

Field for the **locally accepted taxon name** used for a specimen. This means the name which is used e.g. for storage, without being a “real” determination.

**Read-only data field**. This is a temporary storage place for any data that has not yet been put into proper fields on DINA-Web, or is still waiting for data cleaning. This makes data migration faster, as a specimen can be migrated into the system even if contains some special fields.

There is also an **early prototype of a curated locality management** tool. (Accessible form the left sidebar.) This can be used to browser, add and edit hierarchical localities, e.g. continents, countries and provinces. It can also be customized to work with other hierarchical data, e.g. taxonomy and storage locations (e.g. rooms and cabinets). This is work-in-progress, and contains some known bugs.

*The tool offers also a side-by-side view which allows editing locality data while seeing the related localities.*

## Next we are going to do

Develop new features according to the designs made, including
- Adding additional identifiers, e.g. from different data management systems
- “Recording events”: information on when and by who was the record created or edited in previous systems (sensu lato), e.g. old database or catalogue cards.
- Better storage location management, using aforementioned locality management tool

Infrastructure work on database and user interface, and testing how the system can handle large amounts of data. Also a new system (Elasticsearch) for creating better search tools is being tested.

New features being planned for handling:
- Type specimen
- Specimen origin
- Death circumstances
